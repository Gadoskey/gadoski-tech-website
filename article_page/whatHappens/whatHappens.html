          What happens when you type 'https://www.google.com' in your browser

      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Have you ever wondered what happens when you pick up your phone or
          computer, open your browser — be it Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or
          another — and type in “https://www.google.com"? It seems almost
          magical: you press “Enter,” and the Google homepage appears almost
          instantly. But hold up — while we're busy thinking it's instant
          internet magic, a lot is happening behind the scenes. It's like
          expecting a pizza to appear in your hands after you hit 'order now' —
          if only it were that simple, right?

          Imagine a team of busy little robots running around, finding IP
          addresses, making secure connections, and moving data super fast, all
          to make sure you can instantly look up why dogs tilt their heads.
          Sounds interesting? This write-up will break down the fascinating
          series of events that take place to make this possible, including DNS
          resolution, establishing a secure connection, HTTP requests, the role
          of load balancers, firewalls, web servers, application servers,
          databases, and finally, rendering and displaying the page. Well,
          buckle up, because we're about to dive into how it all works below!
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img1.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">DNS Resolution</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          The process of DNS resolution involves converting a domain name or
          hostname (such as <a href="https://www.google.com">google.com</a>)
          into an IP address (such as 8.8.8.8). It converts a human-readable
          domain name into its corresponding IP address so that your browser can
          locate and access the website.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          When you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser , the first
          thing your browser does is check its cache to see if it already knows
          the IP address for Google. You might be wondering, what a cache and an
          IP address are. Well, a cache is like your browser's little notepad
          where it jots down addresses it's visited recently so that it can find
          them faster next time. Every device on the Internet has its unique IP
          address, which is essential for locating that device — just like a
          room number helps you find a specific room in a large hotel. As
          mentioned earlier, a common example of an IP address is 8.8.8.8. This
          particular IP address belongs to Google's public DNS service.
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img2.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Unluckily, if your browser does not know the IP address for Google it
          needs to find out the IP address, which is where DNS (Domain Name
          System) comes in. Think of DNS as the internet's phonebook. Your
          browser sends a request to a DNS server to find out what IP address
          corresponds to “google.com”. This request can travel through several
          DNS servers, each passing it along until the correct IP address is
          found. Once your browser gets the address, it knows where to send your
          request next.
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img3.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />

      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">TCP Connection</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Once the IP address is known, your browser initiates a TCP
          (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to Google's web server at
          that IP address.
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img4.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />

      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          TCP ensures reliable communication by managing the connection setup,
          data transfer, acknowledgment, and termination processes. Imagine a
          phone call between two people who want to have a conversation. In TCP,
          this is like the process of setting up a connection. Your computer
          makes sure the other computer, which hosts Google's server, is
          available and ready to talk before starting the conversation. This
          involves a three-way handshake process:
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          1. SYN: Your browser sends a synchronized packet to Google's server to
          start the connection
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          2. SYN-ACK: The server then responds with a synchronize-acknowledgment
          packet.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          3. ACK: Your browser sends an acknowledgment packet back to the
          server.
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img5.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          After a successful connection, data is transferred in segments. When
          you type https://www.google.com in your browser and hit enter, your
          request is broken down into smaller data segments. Each segment
          includes a sequence number that helps in reordering the segments at
          the destination if they arrive out of order. TCP uses a mechanism
          called windowing to control the flow of data. It ensures that the
          sender does not overwhelm the receiver by sending more data than it
          can handle. Each segment also includes a checksum to detect errors in
          the data. If a segment is corrupted, it is retransmitted.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Further, for each data segment received, the receiving computer (in
          our case, Google's server) sends an ACK back to the sender. This
          acknowledgment indicates that the segment was received correctly. If
          the sender does not receive an acknowledgment within a certain time,
          it will retransmit the segment. TCP uses retransmission timers to
          detect and recover lost packets by sending them again.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          So, the data sent in segments includes the requests we make when
          typing a URL like https://www.google.com. TCP ensures that these
          requests are delivered reliably and in the correct order, making sure
          that we get the web pages we want to access smoothly and efficiently.
          The connection remains open until the page has been fully rendered.

        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">TLS Handshake</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Since you are accessing the site via HTTPS (a secured version of
          HTTP), a TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake occurs to establish
          a secure connection. TLS is an encryption and authentication protocol
          designed to secure Internet communications. This involves exchanging
          cryptographic keys and verifying the server's certificate (usually
          signed by a trusted Certificate Authority such as Let's Encrypt,
          GoDaddy, Entrust and many more). SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, was the
          original security protocol developed for HTTP. It has since been
          superseded by TLS, or Transport Layer Security. Nowadays, the process
          formerly referred to as SSL handshakes is called TLS handshakes,
          although the term “SSL” remains widely used.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          TLS 1.3, the latest version of the Transport Layer Security protocol,
          brings a major speed boost with its handshake process. Unlike earlier
          versions that required multiple exchanges between the client and
          server — known as round trips — TLS 1.3 can complete the handshake
          with zero round trips. This means that the secure connection is
          established almost instantly, speeding up the process and improving
          security.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Here's a simple bonus: If you've visited the Google website before,
          the client and server can use a special shared key from the first
          visit, called the “resumption main secret.” During that first visit,
          the server gives the client a session ticket. When you return to the
          website, your browser can use this key and ticket to quickly set up
          the secure connection again without starting from scratch. This makes
          reconnecting faster and more seamless.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">HTTP Request</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          After your browser resolves the IP address through DNS and establishes
          a secure connection using TLS, it's time for the next step: making an
          HTTP GET request. Your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server
          which includes the request lines (HTTP method, the path to the
          resource, etc.) the request headers that provide information about the
          client (browser type, language, etc.), and the request body (optional
          section here as it is mainly used in POST requests to send data to the
          server, such as form submissions).
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Here's what an HTTP GET request might look like:

        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img6.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />

      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">Firewall</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Before your request reaches Google's web server, it first passes
          through a firewall. It's important to dwell on firewall because it
          plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of web interactions.
          Think of the firewall as a security checkpoint. Its job is to screen
          incoming requests to make sure they are safe and legitimate.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Imagine you're trying to enter a secure building. The security guard
          checks your ID and questions why you're there. If everything looks
          good, you're allowed inside. Similarly, the firewall inspects each
          request for signs of malicious activity or unauthorized access
          attempts.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          For example, if someone tries to send harmful code or exploit
          vulnerabilities, the firewall blocks those requests. Only the safe and
          authorized requests make it through to Google's web server. This helps
          protect Google's servers from potential threats and ensures that your
          visit to https://www.google.com is secure.
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">

      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">Load Balancer</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Once the secure connection is established, finally, your request
          reaches Google's load balancer. It's also important to talk about this
          step because load balancers play a crucial role in managing internet
          traffic. They act like traffic directors, distributing incoming
          requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes
          overwhelmed. This helps improve resource use, reduce delays, and
          increase reliability. The load balancer decides which server will
          handle your request based on factors like how busy each server is, the
          health of each server, and where the server is located geographically.
          After considering all these factors, it then sends your request to one
          of Google's web servers.
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">
          <img class="whatHappensImage" src="img8.jpg" alt="Google Picture" />

      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">Web Server</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Once the load balancer has directed your request to a specific server,
          the server begins processing it to determine what content to send
          back, in this case, the Google homepage. The server retrieves the
          necessary data to display Google's homepage. This includes fetching
          the HTML, images, and other static resources that make up the main
          page.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">Application Server</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          After the request passes through the firewall and reaches Google's web
          server, it is handed off to the application server. The application
          server is crucial for managing more complex tasks beyond serving
          static files and resources. It plays a key role in turning the static
          resources provided by the web server into a fully functional and
          customized webpage. Here's a breakdown of its role:
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          1. Running Dynamic Code: The application server executes scripts and
          programs that generate dynamic content. For example, when you visit
          https://www.google.com, the application server might run code to
          customize the homepage based on your location or preferences, even
          though you're not performing a search.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          2. Handling Business Logic: It processes the business logic required
          to build the web page. For instance, the application server manages
          how different elements on the homepage are arranged and ensures that
          interactive features, like language settings or theme preferences,
          work correctly.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          3. Managing Sessions: If you have an active session or cookies from
          previous visits, the application server checks these to provide a
          personalized experience. It might adjust what you see on the homepage
          based on your past interactions with Google.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          4. Communicating with the Database: Although the homepage might not
          need extensive data from the database, the application server is
          responsible for fetching or updating information as needed. For
          example, if the homepage includes personalized content, the
          application server might retrieve relevant data from Google's
          database.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          5. Preparing the Response: After processing the request and running
          the necessary code, the application server collaborates with the
          webserver to prepare the HTTP response. This response includes the
          final content to be sent back to your browser.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">Database</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Database plays a crucial yet often behind-the-scenes role when you
          visit Google's homepage. In essence, it holds a wealth of information
          necessary for various features and services. This might include
          storing user preferences, session information, and any data relevant
          to personalization. Although you're just visiting the homepage, the
          database can provide personalized content if you have cookies or a
          logged-in session.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          For instance, if Google tailors its homepage based on your location or
          language preferences, the application server queries the database to
          fetch and display this information. Moreover, if you've interacted
          with Google services before, the database keeps track of your settings
          and preferences, so when you visit the homepage, the application
          server might retrieve this data to ensure a consistent and
          personalized experience.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensTextHeader">HTTP Response</div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          After processing the request and running the necessary code, the
          application server collaborates with the webserver to prepare the HTTP
          response, which includes:

          Rendering and Displaying the Page
        </div>
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Once your browser receives the HTTP response from Google's servers, it
          begins the process of rendering and displaying the Google homepage.
          The browser starts by parsing the HTML content from Google's server.
          This HTML includes the structure of the Google homepage, such as the
          search box, Google logo, and buttons. The browser constructs the
          Document Object Model (DOM), a tree-like structure representing these
          elements. Each HTML element, like the search bar and buttons, becomes
          a node in the DOM, providing a framework for the browser to understand
          and manipulate the content.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          As the browser parses the HTML, it identifies links to additional
          resources such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images. For
          the Google homepage, this might include styles for the search box and
          images for the Google logo. The browser sends requests to fetch these
          resources, ensuring that the complete set of components needed to
          display the page is available.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          The browser then parses the CSS files it retrieved to build the CSS
          Object Model (CSSOM). The CSSOM defines how the elements in the DOM
          should be styled. For example, it will include styles for the search
          box's appearance, the alignment of the Google logo, and the layout of
          buttons. This model works with the DOM to apply these styles
          correctly.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Combining the DOM and CSSOM, the browser creates the render tree. This
          tree includes all visible elements, like the Google search bar and
          logo, and their corresponding styles. Elements that are not visible,
          such as hidden ads or elements with display: none, are excluded from
          this tree.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          The browser calculates the size and position of each element on the
          render tree, a step known as layout or reflow. For Google's homepage,
          this means determining where the search box, logo, and buttons will
          appear on the screen. Further, it arranges these elements based on
          factors like the size of the viewport and the dimensions of other
          elements.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          With the layout complete, the browser starts painting. This step
          involves rendering the visual aspects of the page, such as applying
          colors, borders, and backgrounds. For Google's homepage, the browser
          paints the search bar in its designated color, displays the Google
          logo, and styles the buttons as specified.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          If there are JavaScript files or inline scripts on the homepage, the
          browser executes them. For example, JavaScript might manage
          interactive features like the search button's functionality or handle
          user interactions. This script can also make the page more dynamic by
          updating content or reacting to user actions.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          Once the rendering process is complete, the browser displays the fully
          constructed and styled webpage. You see the fully styled and
          functional page, including the search bar, Google logo, and buttons.
          The page appears as intended, with all elements in their proper places
          and ready for use.

        <div class="whatHappensImageContainer">

          TCP termination typically occurs after the web page has been fully
          rendered, as mentioned above. Once the browser has received all
          necessary data segments to complete the web page, the connection is
          closed using a four-way handshake process:

          As you interact with the homepage, such as typing a query into the
          search box or clicking the “Google Search” button, the browser may
          send additional requests to Google's servers. These interactions can
          trigger new HTTP requests to process your search query or navigate to
          other pages, continuing the dynamic nature of the browsing experience.

          Google's homepage may include features that update in response to your
          actions, such as dynamic search suggestions or updates to the page
          layout. The browser handles these updates smoothly, ensuring that the
          page remains responsive and engaging throughout your interaction.

          In sum, when you visit https://www.google.com, a complex sequence of
          technological processes works behind the scenes to display Google's
          homepage on your device. Initially, your browser translates the domain
          name into an IP address through DNS resolution. It then establishes a
          secure connection with Google's servers using TLS. Once the secure
          connection is set up, your browser sends an HTTP request to Google's
          servers. This request is handled by a load balancer that distributes
          incoming traffic across multiple servers, optimizing performance and
          reliability.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="whatHappensTextContainer">
        <div class="whatHappensText">
          The web server processes the request, possibly interacting with an
          application server and a database to retrieve or manage data needed to
          generate the homepage. A firewall plays a crucial role throughout this
          process by protecting the servers from unauthorized access and
          potential threats, ensuring that only legitimate requests are
          processed. After the request is processed, your browser begins
          rendering the page. This involves parsing the HTML, fetching
          additional resources, and building the visual representation of the
          page. Finally, the fully rendered Google homepage is displayed on your
          screen, allowing you to interact with it. This entire process, from
          initial request to final display, involves multiple layers of
          technology and security measures that work together to provide a
          seamless and secure browsing experience.
