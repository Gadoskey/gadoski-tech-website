          <div class="about2">
            Rock-Paper-Scissors is a timeless hand game played between two
            people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes
            with their hand: rock, paper, or scissors. It's simple, fun, and
            widely recognized across the globe. In this digital version of the
            classic game, players can compete against the computer, testing
            their strategy and luck. The rules remain the same: rock crushes
            scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Keep track of
            your wins, losses, and ties as you play, and see if you can beat the
            machine.
